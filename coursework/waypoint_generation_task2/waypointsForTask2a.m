%WAYPOINTSFORTASK2A Computes a sequence of waypoints to achieve task 2a.
%The task involves picking up cubes from three starting locations and
%transfering them to three finishing locations.
%gripperZAbovePickUpCube is a z-coordinate above the pick up cube where the
%gripper can savely move around.
%startLocations is a list of structs with attributes x and y.
%endLocations is a list of structs with attributes x and y.
%gripperZPlaceDownCube is the z-coordinate where the gripper should place
%down the cube.
%gripperZAbovePlacedCube is a z-coordinate above the placed down cube where
%the gripper can savely move around.
%gripperOpenPos is the encoder value that results in an open gripper.
%gripperCubeHoldPos is the encoder value that results in a gripper that
%tightly encloses a cube.
